## 🔗 Google Calendar Integration

The calendar page fetches events from a shared Google Calendar via the Events REST API. It now uses a Google Service Account (JWT), not an API key. Set the following environment variables in `.env.local`:

```bash
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID=your_calendar_id@group.calendar.google.com
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL=service-account-name@project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIE...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
# Optional (defaults to America/Detroit)
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_TIMEZONE=America/Detroit
```

Details:
- API route: `/api/calendar/events` requires `timeMin` and `timeMax` ISO strings.
- Responses are cached for 5 minutes with stale-while-revalidate for 1 hour.
- Share the target Google Calendar with the service account email with at least "See all event details" permission (the calendar does not need to be public).
- In Google Cloud Console: enable "Google Calendar API" on the project that owns the service account.
